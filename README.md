Enhancing Heavy-Duty Vehicle Safety through Advanced Fault Detection

---

## Overview

Sensor-Fault-Detection is a groundbreaking project focused on improving the safety and efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles by accurately detecting failures within the Air Pressure System (APS). Leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced technologies, our solution aims to minimize unnecessary repairs and associated costs while optimizing vehicle performance.

## Problem Statement

The APS is a critical component of heavy-duty vehicles, responsible for providing pressurized air for braking and gear changes. Distinguishing between APS failures and failures caused by other components is challenging, leading to increased maintenance costs and compromised vehicle safety. Our project addresses this issue through binary classification, accurately identifying APS-related failures to optimize repair decisions.

## Solution Proposed

Our solution focuses on developing a robust fault detection system capable of accurately classifying APS failures. By analyzing data from various components of the APS, we minimize false predictions and optimize repair decisions, ultimately enhancing vehicle safety and efficiency. Leveraging Python, Flask, Docker, and MongoDB, we've created a scalable and efficient solution for fault detection.
